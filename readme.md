# Lasagna-Loving Developer
Hello there! I'm a developer who likes to keep things simple, especially when it comes to my GitHub profile. I don't have fancy graphs showing my top programming languages or fancy progress bars displaying the status of my projects.

Instead, I'll tell you about my true passion: **LASAGNA!** It's my absolute favorite food and I could eat it every day.

In fact, there should be a language called Lasagna.
